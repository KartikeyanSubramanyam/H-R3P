# H-R3P

This repository is made for all exploratory/research tasks that I come across/was assigned while working on the ARPA-H project H-R3P.

## Cellular Analysis

This directory consists of the research done to answer the following question: how many HDOs across the U.S. are close enough to a Cell Tower such that the HDOs would have a cellular signal (independent of ISP). For this analysis, I used the **AHA** (American Hospital Association) database that was acquired for H-R3P work that consists of ~6,230 hospital records, and correlated this data with **OpenCelliD's** cellular database that consists of ~7.2 million records.
